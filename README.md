# listFul

  An app for making lists. I am a "lister." If you like to list as much as I do, you may find this app useful to you because you can create lists from scratch or from a template. And you can turn a list into a template.

## About listFul

  [listFul](https://lisamsmith100.github.io/listFul/) lets users generate a list with items and generate templates with items. A list or template can be created, edited, or deleted from the browser and all actions need to be authenticated.

  listFul is built using javascript, Handlebars, HTML, and CSS and relies on a Rails API/Postgres to persist data. Code for that API can be found at lisamsmith100/listFul-rails-api](<https://github.com/lisamsmith100/listFul-rails-api>).
